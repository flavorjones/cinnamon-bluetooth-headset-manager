## Features

Please keep in mind that in the spirit of Readme-driven-development, this list of features is aspirational until a 1.0 release is made.

* detect when a Bluetooth headset is connected (make an applet icon visible)
* provide one-click toggling between A2DP (stereo listening) and HSP (mic + mono) modes

If this seems like a pretty short list of features, it's also an achievable set of features for a 1.0 release.
